            <p><said>"Well, <persName><roleName>Prince</roleName></persName>, so Genoa and Lucca are
                  now just family estates of the Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don't tell me
                  that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors

                  <forename>Vasíli</forename>
                  <surname>Kurágin</surname></persName>, a man of high rank and importance, who was
               the first to arrive at her reception. <name>Anna Pávlovna</name> had had a cough for
               some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new
